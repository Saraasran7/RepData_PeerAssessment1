# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

This repository contains the complete analysis for the Coursera course **Reproducible Research**, Peer Assessment 1.

## Project Overview

The project analyzes activity monitoring data collected from a personal activity monitoring device worn by an individual over two months. The goal is to explore the data, handle missing values, and compare activity patterns on weekdays versus weekends.

## Files Included

- `activity.csv` — The raw dataset containing the steps, date, and interval data.  
- `PA1_template.Rmd` — The R Markdown file containing all the code, analysis, and plots for the assignment.  
- `PA1_template.html` — The knitted HTML output report generated from the R Markdown file.  
- `figures/` — Folder containing all plots generated during the analysis (if any).  

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have R and RStudio installed.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Open `PA1_template.Rmd` in RStudio.  
4. Ensure the `activity.csv` file is in the same directory or update the file path accordingly inside the Rmd file.  
5. Knit the R Markdown document to generate the HTML report.  

## Summary

This analysis covers:  
- Loading and preprocessing the data  
- Calculating total steps per day and plotting histograms  
- Creating time series plots of average daily activity  
- Imputing missing values using interval averages  
- Comparing activity patterns on weekdays vs weekends
